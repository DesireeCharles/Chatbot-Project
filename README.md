Project Description

This project focuses on developing a chat server application that accommodates multiple clients and incorporates advanced artificial intelligence (AI) functionalities. The goal is to produce a resilient and streamlined server application that facilitates real-time communication among numerous clients. Additionally, the integration of AI algorithms will empower the system to generate intelligent and insightful responses.

Contribution by each member 

Throughout the project's development, both members of the group made an approximately equal contribution of around 50% each. Our development process heavily relied on pair programming, which played a crucial role in promoting active collaboration, facilitating solution discussions, and enabling joint efforts on all tasks by both members. It is worth highlighting that both individuals were equally engaged in every aspect of the project, actively collaborating, discussing solutions, and working together on each task. The combined efforts of both members greatly contributed to the overall success of the project.
